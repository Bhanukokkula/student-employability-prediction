Student Employability Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the employability of students based on various factors such as academic performance, skills, and extracurricular activities. The prediction is implemented using three different machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

## Features
- **Data Source:** The dataset used for this project contains information about students, including academic scores, skills, internship experience, and other relevant attributes.
  
- **Algorithms:**
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** KNN is employed to predict employability based on the similarity of a student's features to those of its k-nearest neighbors in the training dataset.
  
  - **Decision Tree:** Decision trees are used to make predictions by recursively partitioning the data based on features, creating a tree-like structure.
  
  - **Random Forest:** Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages can be installed using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

markdown
Copy code

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:**
 - Ensure the dataset is in the correct format and includes all the necessary features.
 - Preprocess the data to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.

2. **Training:**
 - Run the `train_knn.py`, `train_decision_tree.py`, and `train_random_forest.py` scripts to train the respective models on the prepared dataset.

3. **Prediction:**
 - Use the trained models to make predictions on new data by running the `predict.py` script.

## Files
- **data.csv:** Sample dataset containing student information.
- **train_knn.py:** Script for training the K-Nearest Neighbors model.
- **train_decision_tree.py:** Script for training the Decision Tree model.
- **train_random_forest.py:** Script for training the Random Forest model.
- **predict.py:** Script for making predictions using the trained models.
- **requirements.txt:** List of Python packages required for the project.

## Results
- Provide insights into the accuracy and performance of each model.
- Include any relevant visualizations or metrics to demonstrate the effectiveness of the predictions.

## Future Work
- Discuss potential improvements or enhancements that can be made to the model.
- Consider incorporating more features, experimenting with hyperparameter tuning, or exploring other machine learning algorithms.
